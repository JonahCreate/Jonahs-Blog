    <h1>Concept of the Day -- Define: Brand</h1>
    <div class="texts-container">
        <p>Here&apos;s my definition: A brand is a set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a customer&apos;s decision to choose one product or service over another. If the consumer(whether it&apos;s a business, a buyer, a voter or a donor) doesn&apos;t pay a premium, make a selection, or spread the word, then no brand value exists for that consumer. </p>
        <p>A brand value is merely the sum total of how much extra people will pay, or how often they choose, the expectations, memories, stories and relationships of one brand over the alternatives.</p>
        <p>A brand used to be something else. A brand used to be a logo or a design or a wrapper. Today, that&apos;s a shadow of the brand, something that might mark the brand&apos;s existence. But just as it takes more than a hat to be a cowboy, it takes more than a designer prattling on about the texture to make a brand. If you&apos;ve never heard of it, if you wouldn&apos;t choose it, if you don&apos;t recommend it, then there is no brand, at least not for you. </p>
        <p>If you hear a designer say this(believe it or not, I did not make this quote up), “A TCHO Chocolate bar, with its algorithmic guilloche patterns, looks like a modern form of currency. “Modern” was always part of the brand brief — no faux traditionalism, but resolutely forward-looking for a new generation of chocolate enthusiasts…” then I wonder if there&apos;s a vocabulary disconnect.  </p>
        <p><i>Design is essential but design is not a brand.</i></p>
        <p> </p>

        <h3>My Takeaway</h3>
        <p>A brand is more than its look; it's about the experiences and connections that shape consumer choices. While design matters, the real power of a brand lies in the intangible value it holds for consumers.</p>
